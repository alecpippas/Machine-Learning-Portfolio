# Custom Convolutional Neural Network Framework

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework from scratch using only NumPy, demonstrating deep understanding of CNN fundamentals and computer vision principles. Rather than relying on high-level frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow, this implementation builds every component from mathematical foundations, providing insights into the inner workings of modern deep learning systems.

**What it does:** The framework implements a 2-layer CNN architecture for binary image classification, featuring custom convolution operations, multiple activation functions, and a nearest-neighbor classifier. It demonstrates feature extraction through edge detection filters and shows how CNNs learn hierarchical representations.

**Why it's interesting:** This project showcases the ability to build core deep learning algorithms rather than just use them. Understanding CNN operations at this level is crucial for computer vision engineering roles, as it demonstrates both mathematical rigor and practical implementation skills. The framework reveals how convolutional layers extract meaningful features from raw pixel data.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure Jupyter notebook is available for interactive analysis

### Running the Framework

#### Basic CNN Operations
```python
# Define custom filters
W1 = np.array([[100, 100], [-100, -100]])  # Horizontal edge detector
W2 = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 1]])            # Pattern aggregator

# Apply convolution with custom stride and padding
output_size = output_map_size(input_image, filter, stride=1, padding=0)

# Perform convolution operation
result = single_filter_convoltion(input_patch, filter)
```

#### Multi-Layer CNN Processing
```python
# Process images through 2-layer CNN
for img in images:
    # Layer 1: Edge detection with hard sign activation
    layer1_output = apply_convolution_layer(img, W1, hard_sign_activation)
    
    # Layer 2: Pattern aggregation (no activation)
    layer2_output = apply_convolution_layer(layer1_output, W2)
    
    # Generate feature embeddings
    embedding = layer2_output.flatten()
```

#### Classification and Evaluation
```python
# Perform nearest neighbor classification
for test_embedding in test_embeddings:
    # Compute L2 distances to training samples
    dist_to_class0 = L2_Norm(train_embeddings[0], test_embedding)
    dist_to_class1 = L2_Norm(train_embeddings[1], test_embedding)
    
    # Predict class based on minimum distance
    predicted_class = 0 if dist_to_class0 < dist_to_class1 else 1
```
