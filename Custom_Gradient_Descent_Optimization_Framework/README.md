# Custom Gradient Descent Optimization Framework

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive optimization framework from scratch, demonstrating deep understanding of fundamental machine learning algorithms. Rather than relying on pre-built libraries, this implementation builds gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent optimizers from the mathematical ground up, including advanced features like adaptive learning rates, regularization, and numerical stability improvements.

**What it does:** The framework implements complete optimization algorithms for logistic regression, including fixed and adaptive learning rates, L2 regularization, and stochastic gradient descent variants. It provides comprehensive analysis tools for learning rate selection, convergence monitoring, and performance comparison between different optimization approaches.
