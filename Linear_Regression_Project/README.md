# Linear Regression Analysis: Housing Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental machine learning concepts through comprehensive linear regression analysis on the Ames Housing dataset. The analysis explores data visualization, model fitting from scratch, and compares different loss functions to understand their impact on predictive performance.

**Key Question**: How well can we predict house prices using different features, and how do various loss functions affect our model's performance?
